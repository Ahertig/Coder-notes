Commit notes, dmoore, 03/30/16 7:30pm

## login functionality
* when you log in, you will be redirected to the /notes page

## Front-end notes page changes
* The /notes page display all of your notebooks dynamically
* The Notebooks tab displays the actual notes for each notebook. If you click a notebook title, the note IDs will appear below.
* Tried testing Tonic Dev inside the note body. Did not see a code editor. Need to continue testing.
